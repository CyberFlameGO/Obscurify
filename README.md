## What's up ya'll, welcome to Obscurify

The goal here is to show you as many interesting things about
your Spotify listening history as possible, and to quantify
how unique your taste is compared to everyone else.

Obscurify is designed with a serverless architecture hosted in AWS. It uses API Gateway with Lambda to host the backend, while the frontend is deployed with Amplify.

This project contains two elements: on the backend are some Lambda functions in the `/lambda` directory, and in `/frontend` an Angular 9 app.
