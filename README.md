## What's up ya'll, welcome to Obscurify

The goal here is to show you as many interesting things about
your Spotify listening history as possible, and to quantify
how unique your taste is compared to everyone else.


This project contains two elements: on the backend are some Lambda functions in the `/lambda` directory, and on the frontend an Angular 9 app found in `/frontend`.
