    About
  </h2>
  <p class="about-text">
    The goal of Obscurify is to help you better understand your own music taste. It uses
    Spotify's <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">Web API</a> to display your listening history, define
    your top genres, and to recommend under-the-radar songs you might like.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    The global popularity ratings of the artists in your lists are aggregated to result in an Obscurity score
    which is compared to the Obscurify users in your country to show how unique (or energetic, danceable, and happy) a music taste you have.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    Obscurify can also make playlists of the music in your track lists and place them in your Spotify library - including the historical snapshots
    that are saved when you view your Obscurify profile each month.
  </p>

  <h5>Us</h5>
  <p class="about-text">
    Obscurify was birthed in the winter of '16 by full-stack developer
    <a href="mailto:oliveroalex@gmail.com">Alex Olivero</a>. Come fall '17, he would cross paths with the
    enterprising <a href="mailto:npatel663@gmail.com">Nirmal Patel</a>, a front-end dev/UX designer
    who would catalyze the site redesign that launched soon after.

  <h2 class="faq-header">F.A.Q.</h2>

  <h5>How is my data used?</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
    To use Obscurify, you'll need to allow the app to have access to some of your account information -
    that being your username, the country your account is registered to, and the artists/tracks
    that appear on your lists.
  </p>

  <h5>Where does the artist and track ranking come from?</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
  The content and order of your lists come directly from <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">Spotify's API</a>.
  Popularity, genres, and musical traits are all determined by Spotify.
  </p>

  <h5>Why are there no (or few) results showing up in my All-Time and Current lists?</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
  If you listen in Private Mode, those songs will not be recorded and won't be reflected in either list.
  If your account is fairly new, it is normal for your All-Time list to be short, as it takes some time for Spotify to update their information.
  </p>

  <h5>Some of the genres seem a little off...</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
  Spotify can attribute some artists with a few dozen genres. These range from very general (like "rock") to a little
  more interesting (like "escape room").
  </p>

  <h5>My lists aren't updating</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
  There is no defined schedule for when Spotify updates the data in your lists - it's normal for delays, but expect an average of one to two weeks.
  </p>

  <h5>I have some other issue (or concern, compliment, maybe a suggestion)</h5>
  <p class="faq-text">
    I'd like to know about it! <a href="mailto:oliveroalex@gmail.com">Send me an email!</a>
