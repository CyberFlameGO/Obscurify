		  <h5>How is my data used?</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		    To use Obscurify, you'll need to allow the app to have access to some of your account information -
		    that being your username, the country your account is registered to, and the artists/tracks
		    that appear on your lists.
		  </p>

		  <h5>Where does the artist and track ranking come from?</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		  The content and order of your lists come directly from <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">Spotify's API</a>.
		  Popularity, genres, and musical traits are all determined by Spotify.
		  </p>

		  <h5>What do the stars mean?</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
			Every artist and song on Spotify is given a global popularity rating. 5 stars means more popular. Less stars, or none, means less popular.
		  </p>

		  <h5>Why are there no (or few) results showing up in my All-Time and Current lists?</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		  If you listen in Private Mode, those songs will not be recorded and won't be reflected in either list.
		  If your account is fairly new, it is normal for your All-Time list to be short, as it takes some time for Spotify to update their information.
		  </p>

		  <h5>Some of the genres seem a little off...</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		  Spotify can attribute some artists with a few dozen genres. These range from very general (like "rock") to a little
		  more interesting (like "escape room").
		  </p>

		  <h5>My lists aren't updating</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		  There is no defined schedule for when Spotify updates the data in your lists - it's normal for delays, but expect an average of one to two weeks.
		  </p>

		  <h5>I have some other issue (or concern, compliment, maybe a suggestion)</h5>
		  <p class="faq-text">
		    I'd like to know about it! <a href="mailto:oliveroalex@gmail.com">Send me an email!</a>
